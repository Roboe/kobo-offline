    <p>JavaScript needs to be enabled to fetch firmware links right from Kobo servers. Sorry about that.</p>
    <p>This site is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPLv3">GPLv3-licensed</a> and doesn't track you (Kobo servers may log your IP, though). You can review the source code at its <a href="https://gitlab.com/Roboe/pangrama">GitLab repo</a> before running it.</p>
